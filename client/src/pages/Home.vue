      Welcome to Openbook, the internet home of fully open communication. This
      will definitely cause no problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Openbook, we believe in the collaborative spirit of the user. We want
      everyone to post whatever is on their minds and to also work together in
      creating a insouciant discourse.
    </p>

    <p>
      We hope that through this freeform structure, everyone will feel empowered
      to truly communicate in a way that is free of toxic behavior.
